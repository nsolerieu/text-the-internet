## Usage

- Download the index file and open it in a text editor, duh
- Edit my silly placeholder content - basic `HTML` knowledge required
- `<br>` are use to create the line break between bubble and allow the text like indent
- Use `unicode` for emoji - like **&#128406;**
- To set the dark theme, just add the `dark-mode` class to the `<body>`
- Get fancy and tweak the `CSS` it's at the top of the file
